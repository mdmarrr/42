## Description

push_swap is a sorting algorithm project from the 42 curriculum.

The goal is to sort a list of integers using two stacks (a and b) and a limited set of operations (swap, push, rotate and reverse rotate), while minimizing the number of moves.

This implementation handles:

- Input parsing & validation
- Duplicate detection
- Index-based sorting
- Optimized small stack sorting (3–5 numbers)
- Chunk-based algorithm for large inputs

This implementation uses:
- Linked lists to represent stacks
- Index normalization
- Chunk-based sorting for large datasets
- Dedicated optimized sorting for small stack sizes

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

git clone git@github.com:mdmarrr/42.git (cambiar)

cd push_swap

2. Compile the project (all source files and libft)

make

---

## Usage

Example:

./push_swap 5 1 4 2 3

The program will output a sequence of operations like:

pb

ra

pb

pa

...

To test with random numbers:

ARG=$(shuf -i 1-500 -n 500 | tr '\n' ' ')
./push_swap $ARG | tee moves | ./checker_linux $ARG
wc -l moves

## Algorithm

1. Indexing

Before sorting, each value is assigned an index based on its sorted position.

Example:

Original: 42 10 30

Sorted:   10 30 42

Indexes:   2  0  1

This allows the algorithm to sort based on relative order instead of actual values.

2. Small Stack Sorting

Special optimized functions:
- ft_sort_three
- ft_sort_four
- ft_sort_five
These handle small cases with minimal operations.

3. Large Stack Sorting (Chunk-Based)

Implemented in big_sort.c.

Strategy:

Divide stack A into chunks:
- ≤ 100 numbers → chunk size = 15
- 100 numbers → chunk size = 35

Push indexed elements to stack B in chunks.

Rotate stack B to position the maximum index at the top.

Push elements back to stack A in sorted order.

This significantly reduces total operations compared to naive approaches.

---

## Operations

- sa:	    Swap first two elements of stack A
- sb:	    Swap first two elements of stack B
- ss:	    sa + sb
- pa:	    Push from B to A
- pb:	    Push from A to B
- ra:	    Rotate A upwards
- rb:	    Rotate B upwards
- rr:	    ra + rb
- rra:    Reverse rotate A
- rrb:	Reverse rotate B
- rrr:	rra + rrb

Operations are implemented across:

- ft_operations.c
- ft_operations2.c
- ft_operations3.c

---

## Features

- Robust argument parsing
- Handles quoted and space-separated input
- Duplicate detection
- Overflow-safe integer parsing
- Memory-safe (manual free management)
- Optimized for small and large datasets
- Modular structure
- Uses custom libft

---

## Dependencies

libft (included in project)

Standard C libraries

Compiled with:

    -Wall -Wextra -Werror

Compiler:

    cc

---

## Error Handling

The program prints:

    Error

When:
- Non-numeric input is detected
- Integer overflow occurs
- Duplicate numbers are provided
- Invalid format is passed
- All allocated memory is properly freed before exit.

---

## Troubleshooting

Nothing prints: Check if input is already sorted.

"Error" appears: Check for duplicates.

Ensure all values are valid integers.

Avoid exceeding INT range.

Test memory leaks with:

valgrind --leak-check=full ./push_swap.a 3 2 1

Example:

./push_swap.a 2 1 3 6 5 8

Output:

sa

pb

ra

...
